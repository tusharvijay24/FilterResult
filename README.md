FilterResult is an iOS application designed to provide multi-selection filter results. This application follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture to ensure a clean separation of concerns and maintainability.


The application is built using the MVVM architecture pattern, which includes the following components:

Model: Represents the application's data layer. It contains the data objects and handles data-related operations.
ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it, and then provides it to the View.
View (ViewController): Manages the user interface, displays data provided by the ViewModel, and handles user interactions.
This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to maintain, test, and extend.

Usage
Filtering: Select multiple criteria using the available filter options, and the app will dynamically display the filtered results.
Customization: You can extend the filtering options and adjust the filtering logic by modifying the FilterViewModel and FilterModel classes.

To build and run this application, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

1. Xcode: Version 15.0 or later
2. iOS SDK: 16.0 or later
3. Deployment Target: iOS 15.0 or later
4. Swift: Version 5.8 or later
