Multi-selection filtering of data.
Dynamic display of filtered results.
Separation of UI logic and business logic using MVVM architecture.
Customizable and extensible filtering options.
Architecture
The application is built using the MVVM architecture pattern, which includes the following components:

Model: Represents the application's data layer. It contains the data objects and handles data-related operations.
ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the View and Model. It retrieves data from the Model, processes it, and then provides it to the View.
View (ViewController): Manages the user interface, displays data provided by the ViewModel, and handles user interactions.
This architecture allows for a clear separation of concerns, making the application easier to maintain, test, and extend.
